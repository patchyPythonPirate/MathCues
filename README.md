Solving Project Euler problem sets

This repository contains practice solutions for mathematical and computer 
science related problems found at projecteuler.net

<--If on GitHub-->
The (attempted) solution files are not intended to be used as an easy 
cheat to gain rep on the site; it is purely for reference. Besides, just 
getting the answers for free takes the fun out of discovering it for 
yourself, and the neat new things you'll learn along the way! 
(Seriously, I feel enlightened after each earnest attempt.)


Each problem will be maintained in its own directory; however, where 
common code becomes shared among problems, it will be moved into a 
"common directory", from where it will be imported to the required 
problem. The same applies for common resources.


The problems presented generally asks a solution for specific parameters; 
where possible, a general solution will be attempted to solve for all 
instances of the problem.


Annotations and explainations with regard to the problem solving method, 
implementation, approach, reasoning etc etc. will be kept within the code 
file itself, followed by the appropriate code.
Should this method prove to be sub-optimal or detract from general 
readibility, it shall be moved to a separate file under the same directory.
