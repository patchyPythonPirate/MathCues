Project Euler - Problem 1

The original challenge tasked participants to solve the puzzle with parameters 
X = 1000 and N = 3,5 only. I wanted to create a function that could solve the 
puzzle for any value of X > 1, and any number of multiples N.

With the original parameters, the puzzle can be solved quickly enough with the 
Brute Force function in the Second Attempt. However, for values larger than 
10^12 the machine would spend upwards of 30 minutes calculating. Using the 
Algebraic method, with the same parameters, it is calculated in mere seconds.

# First Attempt
#
# Did not take into account that some values < X may be shared multiples of 
# N, and therefore counted twice or more into Sum

#                   Brute Force Method

# For integers yielded by dividing numbers from 1 to X(excluding)
# through multiple N, add each integer to total Sum.

def sum_of_mult_bf(x, *n):
    '''Sum of multiples of N, for range of positive numbers less than X'''

    x, n = verify_and_clean_input(x, *n)

    Sum = 0
    for multiple in n:
        for number in range(1,x):
            if number % multiple == 0:
                Sum += number

    return Sum


#                       Algebraic Method
#
# Each multiple N produces a series of multiples of itself upto X
# Thus for each multiple a Sum of series can be determined
# using the base formula of Sn = n/2[2a+(n-1)d]
# which can be reduced because a = d in this instance.
# Dividing X by N yields the NUMber of possible multiples of N
# (as integers) within X. X itself is excluded from possible
# multiples, so we subtract 1 before doing the calculation.
# Repeat for each multiple N and add to total Sum.
#
# Note: The basic method of determining the number of multiples of
#       a single integer within a given range and the subsequent 
#       sum was outsourced to the generator in Attempt 2. Temptation
#       to replace the body of this function with the generator was
#       deferred to preserving the code for historical purposes.

    for multiple in n:
        num_of_terms = (x-1)//multiple
        Sum += (multiple*num_of_terms*(num_of_terms+1))//2
        
    return Sum

#                       Algebraic Method
#
# Using algebraic methods, the puzzle revealed a pattern whereby the Total
# Sum is calculated by adding the sums of each unique combination of the
# possible Multiples together, but multiplying each even combination by
# negative one. This can be demonstrated as:
#
# where f(n) is the sum of all the multiples of n within a given range, and
# where a,b,c is the given multiples, then
#
# Total Sum = f(a) + f(b) + f(c) - f(ab) - f(ac) - f(bc) + f(abc)
